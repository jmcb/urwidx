**Extended widgets and a wxPython-esque interface to `urwid
<http://excess.org/urwid>`_.**

For demonstrations, see *ux/\*test.py*.

Support and Documentation
=========================

Nothing major yet. This is totally alpha software, so use at your own risk.

Documentation is patchy, but will be provided in docstrings and likely
prettified HTML at some point in the future.

General information
===================

urwidx is designed to be supplementary to urwid. It contains a variety of
"extended" widgets, as well as a wxPython-esque interface. The extended widgets
can be used either with the extended interface, or simply plugged into an
existing urwid application as-is.

Installation and usage
======================

Run::

    python setup.py install

You can then access urwidx through the Python interpreter::

    import ux

Currently, there is no usage information. Please see the *ux/\*test.py* series
of files for demonstrations of usage.
